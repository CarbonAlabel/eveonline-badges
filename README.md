The story of this tool starts with a tweet that was linked in the [EVE Creative](https://twitter.com/Eve_Creatives) Discord server: https://twitter.com/Greygal__Eve/status/1132818353871937538

I decided to offer my help, but after reading the description of what was needed, I figured it would be faster to just make it immediately. 15 minutes later, the first version of this tool was ready. After receiving positive feedback on the first version, I proceeded to make further tweaks and add more features, both ones that were requested and some that weren't. I then spent some time cleaning the code up, and publishing it here. While this tool doesn't really need any more work done on it, this will make it simpler to publish updates if required by events such as breaking changes to the underlying APIs.
