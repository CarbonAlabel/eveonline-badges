# CONCORD pilot licenses

In addition to the buttons, at [EVE Vegas 2019](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pzdico/eve-invasion-world-tour-round-seven-eve-vegas-2019), specially designed CONCORD pilot licenses were made available to attendees. Essentially a capsuleer ID card, it features the character's portrait, name, ID, date of birth/creation, race, bloodline, and ancestry.

This tool is used to fill in the licenses with the characters' information.
